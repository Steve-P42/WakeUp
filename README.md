# WakeUp

The initial sequence on Neo's screen when Trinity is first contacting him...

Then there is some Matrix rain and some sound to accompany the show :D


Issues:
The messages are there, and they behave similar to what I want - in the python console.
Exported to an exe file they are not doing the same thing though, so that has to be fixed later.
